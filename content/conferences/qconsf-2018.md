Forget about classroom trainings - they are boring and can give you knowledge, but not practice nor skills. At Booking.com there are two developers, who invented the new way of education - online community marathon with heavy focus on self-reflection and practice - which already helped dozens of their colleagues grow and get promoted to Senior developer role. We call it Game of Roles and it already became an internal "franchise" to help people grow in other career roles (e.g. Team Leads).

In this session you will learn about how did we come up with such concept, what does it mean in details. You will learn about the framework behind each training, and, most important, how can you apply same principles at your organization without much effort but with high outcome.
